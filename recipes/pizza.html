            <p><str>Pizza on the grill</str> is a fantastic way to make <em>pizza at home.</em> The heat of a hot grill is a perfect match for a professional pizza oven. </p>
        Ingredients
            Pizza dough
            <ul>
                <li>1 Cup warm water</li>
                <li>1 Package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
                <li>3 and a half cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
            </ul>
            Garlic oil
            <ul>
                <li>half a cup of olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            </ul>
            Pizza toppings
            <ul>
                <li>one fourth cup tomato sauce, divided</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes, divided</li>
                <li>quarter cup sliced black olives, divided</li>
                <li>quarter cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped, divided</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided</li>
            </ul>
        <str>Steps</str>
            <ol>
            <li> Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
            <li>Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust; then top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil. Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.</li>
            </ol>
